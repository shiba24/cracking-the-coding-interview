Cracking the PFN coding interview
===

This repository offers *unofficial* solutions for the coding interview tests of [Preferred Networks Inc.](https://www.preferred-networks.jp/).

The past questions are available online [officially](https://research.preferred.jp/2016/07/intern-coding-tasks/), although in Japanese. I translated some of them manually and unofficially, which are located in this repository.

My solutions includes python and C++. Feel free to add your answers at any language! I know yours are probably more sophisticated ;)


# Execution of C++ code

Example:

```
c++ -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc ++ pfn2015-1.cpp -o 1.out
```

In case of usage of eigen library:


```
c++ -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -I /usr/local/include/eigen3 pfn2015-2.cpp -o 4.out
```

# TODO

Translate and push the rest of questions in this repository.
